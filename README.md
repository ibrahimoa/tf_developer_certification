We go through the four main blocks of the TensorFlow Developer Certificate exam:
1. Simple DNNs. (folder `1 - Introduction to TensorFlow for AI`)
2. CNNs. (folder `2 - Convolutional Neural Networks in TF`)
3. NLP. (folder `3 - NLP with TensorFlow`)
4. Time Series Forecasting. (folder `4 - Sequences, Time Series and Prediction`)

The code on these folders is from the [DeepLearning.AI TensorFlow Developer Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/tensorflow-in-practice)
on Coursera.

The folder `TensorFlow Udemy Course` is to reinforce some concepts
of NLP and Time Series blocks. The course in this case is [TensorFlow Developer Certificate in 2021: Zero to Mastery](https://www.udemy.com/course/tensorflow-developer-certificate-machine-learning-zero-to-mastery/) from Udemy.
